  - [Gini](https://github.com/go-air/gini)
  - [Reach](https://github.com/go-air/reach)
  - [Zikichombo](https://github.com/zikichombo)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I prototyped and proposed optional static types to Python in 1999 personally to Guido Van Rossum in Reston, he very clearly refused.  Today, Python has very much the same thing.
